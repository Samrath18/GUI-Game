### Java GUI Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Java-based GUI game that allows the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 6. The program provides a graphical user interface with buttons for each number and tracks the user's performance throughout multiple rounds of the game.

#### Features:
- A random number between 1 and 6 is generated each time the user clicks the "Start" button.
- The user has 3 lives per round to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, the program informs the user whether their guess is correct or incorrect.
- If the user runs out of lives without guessing the correct number, the game displays the correct number.
- The program displays the total number of games played, games won, and games lost.
- Users can quit the current round or exit the game entirely with dedicated buttons.

#### Controls:
- **Start**: Begins a new game by generating a random number.
- **Number buttons (1 to 6)**: Used to guess the randomly generated number.
- **Quit**: Ends the current game and displays the correct answer.
- **Exit**: Closes the application.

This program uses Java Swing for its GUI and random number generation, with action listeners handling button click events. The game keeps track of user statistics and updates them after each round.
